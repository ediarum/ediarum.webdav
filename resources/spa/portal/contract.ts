/**
 * ediarum.portal mount contract.
 *
 * This file is the reference that every app frontend (ediarum.webdav, ediarum.zotero,
 * ediarum.index, …) implements to be hosted inside the portal. It is intentionally
 * self-contained (no imports), so app repositories can copy it verbatim into their
 * source tree as `src/portal/contract.ts`. Auth is covered by a separate contract,
 * `docs/auth-contract.md`.
 *
 * How the portal uses it:
 *
 * 1. The portal reads `/config/apps.json` and, for each app, registers the
 *    route `/<id>/…`.
 * 2. When the user opens such a route, the portal loads the app's `entry` URL
 *    (e.g. `/apps/zotero/embed.js`) with a native dynamic `import()`.
 * 3. It checks that the module exports `contractVersion === CONTRACT_VERSION` and a
 *    `mount` function (see {@link AppModule}). Otherwise it shows an error.
 * 4. It calls `mount(el, ctx)` with an empty element that fills the content area
 *    below the portal's top bar, and keeps the returned unmount function.
 * 5. When the user switches to another app, logs out, or leaves the app's routes,
 *    the portal calls the unmount function and then removes `el`.
 *
 * Navigation within the app (`/zotero/a` → `/zotero/b`) does NOT
 * remount the app: the app's own router (created with `createWebHistory(ctx.routerBase)`)
 * handles it. The portal router and the app router share `window.history`.
 *
 * See `docs/integrating-an-app.md` for a step-by-step guide.
